# Backend Development

## Backend

If you don't already have poetry installed, install it using the instructions found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

If you want to watch me struggle getting poetry upgraded from 1.8 to 2.0 [click here](https://youtube.com/live/dguKhVizZ90?feature=share)

- `cd drf`
- Run `poetry install`
- Run `poetry shell` - If you are using poetry version 2.X+ be sure to have the [poetry plugin shell](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-shell) installed.
- `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
- API Server should be running at http://localhost:8000 in your browser
